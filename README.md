### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for checking out my GitHub page!

My name is Jeffrey and I'm currently a 4th year student studying Computer Science at the University of British Columbia with an expected graduation date of May 2021.

##### Why did I study computer science? 

I never set out to study computer science. In fact, I barely had any idea what it was when I started at university. My third semester, I decided to take an introductory computer science class as an elective. Of course, you know the story from here; I loved it so much that ... yada, yada, yada ... but still, what I do want to say is that what I was most fascinated by was how such complex problems could be solved in such a logical, yet simple way.

##### What did I learn?

Throughout my degree, I have had the privilege of being exposed to many different programming languages in both functional and object-oriented programming but perhaps most extensively in:

Java, C++/C, TypeScript, and JavaScript.

With seemingly every other course using a different language and environment setup, I've (through bumps and bruises) managed to accrue 4 years of experience picking up new languages and technologies on-the-fly.

Recently, I've been dabbling in some recursion algorithms and I thought back to perhaps one of the most famous quotes from a professor at my school.

	Trust the natural recursion ...
		Trust the natural recursion ..
			Trust the natural recursion ...
